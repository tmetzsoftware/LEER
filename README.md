# LEER
Land of Eternal Elementals Reborns

What this is: This is a practice project to learn some basics of GIT and Python. All project and system names are draft conceptual and may not be the final end results. 

I am going to attemept to learn this overly complicated project as a realative beginner to coding and programming and keep it documented in this GIT. 
I am making this publically availible and completely open source if you wish to use it.
I am completely open to community support and if there is interest can set up any Discord or Reddit or whatever to take feedback and comments.
If anything comes from this I support using it for any kind of reasearch and development of your own.
I reserve any rights to making any commercial product based off of this code unless it is the base system to get your original product to run. It can not share any direct simularities with this product if you are using this for anything commercial.
Not sure if any of this matters I am really just playing around with learning how to use git to try and push/pull the repo for PyCharm to be honest.
OK I think I am back, still haven't been able to get git to update but at least it finally saved the README file in my explorer from PyCharm. Windows 11 had to go and move menus around didn't they? 

Goals I wish to accomplish:
1. I am going to build a very basic RPG game to learn Python principles and how to optimized read/writting data with Python
2. I am going to play around with making some procedural generation to expand that knowledge
3. I am going to encorporate AI and Machine learning type principles to attempt to expand on the PO
4. I am going to attempt to link everything together:
	a. LEER game is a RPG style game that will have keyboard/mouse action style combat, preferably over the shoulder style 
	b. Players can join up to run a campaign in LEER together
		i. ideally I want to play around with blockchain security of some kind, like keeping player characters on a block chain, for security in multiplayer to learn the principles.
		ii. i want to make it so no one can use this tech to make any kind of crypto currency bullshit in the future
		iii. the use case I want to attempt is purely for learning and probably complete garbage in practice
		iv. basically there can be campaigns in some global ledger of "world" that can use the other systems
			the other systems can then generate new quests, raids, dungeons etc. like the standalone system can
			players can join each others instances using the block chain for security
			their individual PC handles all the game and rendering, server handles validating both clients
			if both clients are validated, the blockchain becomes a local cache of variables for their cluster
			their cluster would be something like cordinates on a world map, AKA cordinates of a 3D array in a blockchain network
			then at fixed intervals the server takes all the clusters data that the local instances are generating
			and combines it all into the master record on the server. 
		v. the cluster will keep the data as a branch on the main chain of all the cluster groupings (such as player parties, or just a large group of players in a small area on the map)
			and will purge and update when the clock cycle on the main branch calls for it to update the chain (like a TCP principle maybe but I honestly am talking out of my ass)
			that will update the chains globally availible cache which is then used to update the next cluster and so on
		vi. then as it goes through the system there global game server can update the whole global world to include new items culture npc etc that are all PO by consolidating the hash data 
			we have been collecting on these chains back into the big blockchain array for the global server, meaning everyone gets new content in an MMO theoretically.
		vii. conceptually, I am picturing a horizontal decentralized P2P MMO server, where through multiple layers there is a very finite footprint on the server hardware and the heavy lifting is done
			in the same manner a single player offline AAA RPG game would generate because all the super heavy data on what generates where is encrypted on the client side and decrypted by using the blockchain
			to have the client talk to the server
		viii. even if this is a garbage approach and there are a ton of reasons why it sucks this is the project, you are free to use anything in this repo and make your own project with your own way of accomplishing it,
			in fact I encourage you to do so! i hope that there are multiple people working on the different components and modules creating unique versions that help a community of awesome people make awesome games and
			learn how to do stupid shit just because you can. 
		viv: this bullet point is just so I can make this list 10 long and call it my 10 commadments while I work through the whole project because I know there are times I will go insane, and I am probably stopping for
		a cigarette already because github keeps refusing to let me update this document, upgrading to windows 11 may have been a mistake right before trying this 
		x: remember, not everyone learns the same way. I want to test how something works compared to how it is normally used to see its full range and limitations. This is how I learn how to use something effectively.
			I always give up learning to code because I memorize Syntax and then give up because I can't get what I want to do to work. ChatGPT gives code for ridiculous concepts that kinda sorta works. I think this is
			a way to finally learn to code properly instead of basic command line prompts to do basic methods. 
	c. LEER will use the MAGIC engine to be able to generate the campaign in a rougelite fashion
	d. MAGIC will be able to use the RAIDD system to generate content for the campaign using AI modeling techniques
	e. MAGIC and RAIDD will use AROMA to generate unique world histories to allow for theoretical infitinite generation 
		i. we parse really old data because we have the AI model that can guess 
		ii. aroma is indexing and making a corpus so well that the file to keep the history becomes super tiny
		iii. if ChatGPT can do it, why not a network of gamers PC's and a tiny footprint of data on a neural net to PO generate an MMO?
